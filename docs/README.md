# Goofy
Library for interaction [Spotify Web API](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Google Apps Script](https://developers.google.com/apps-script). Based on the idea of the service[Smarter Playlists](http://smarterplaylists.playlistmachinery.com/about.html). The library seeks to bypass some shortcomings of the service, add new features and increase allowable limits. Besides Spotify, the source of tracks can be[Last.fm](https://chimildic.github.io/goofy/#/func?id=lastfm), [Yandex.Music](https://chimildic.github.io/goofy/#/func?id=yandex), [FM radio station tracklists](https://github.com/Chimildic/goofy/discussions/35).

##What It Does
In short, Goofy is a playlist building. It can collect tracks from various sources, pass feeds through many different sources and create/update a playlist on a schedule.

For example, a few short algorithms:
- Merge daily mixes and remove previously listened tracks
- Collect tracks from a playlist using keywords
- Mix in tracks from different FM radio stations
- Reveal tracks that havent been listened to in a long time
- Collect new items from tracked artits
- Receive Last.fm recommendations from any user
- Transfer tracks from Yandex.Music to Spotify, including favorites (likes)
