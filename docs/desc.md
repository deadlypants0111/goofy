## Определения

Goofy - library for interaction [Spotify Web API] (https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/web-api/) and [Google Apps Script] (https://developers.google.com/apps-script). It is based on the idea of the [Smarter Playlists] service (http://smarterplaylists.playlistmachinery.com/about.html). The library seeks to eliminate the shortcomings of the service, add new features and increase the allowable limits.

Web API - hotspot to Spotify. Allows you to receive and modify data.

Apps Script - the platform on which the library code runs. Including on schedule.

## Benefits of Goofy

- Free scheduled execution on Google servers
- Preservation [истории прослушиваний](/desc?id=История-прослушиваний) up to 20 thousand tracks and history with Lastfm
- Filters and recommendations for genres and other parameters
- Receiving tracks [отслеживаемых плейлистов](/func?id=getfollowedtracks)
- Transferring tracks from Yandex.Music and Last fm
- Aggregation of playlists of small and medium authors
- Create playlists with 11 thousand tracks (limit for Spotify)
- Cyrillic support (titles, descriptions, filters)
- And many other possibilities

## Differences from Smarter Playlists

The main difference lies in the way the algorithm is composed. Smarter Playlists visual language, diagram. In the case of Goofy, a programming language is used. No, you don't need to learn programming. It is enough to copy the proposed templates. Modify them as necessary. Below is an example for comparison.

An example of creating a playlist in Smarter Playlists. Algorithm: take tracks from two playlists, perform random sorting, save the first 50 tracks to a new playlist.

Now an example of the same algorithm using Goofy. Explanation of how the code works in other chapters.
```js
let playlists = [
    { name: 'Микс дня 1', id: '123' },
    { name: 'Микс дня 2', id: '456' },
];

let tracks = Source.getTracks(playlists);

Order.shuffle(tracks);

Playlist.saveAsNew({
    name: 'Личный микс дня',
    tracks: Selector.sliceFirst(tracks, 50),
});
```

## Restrictions

The library is subject to platform restrictions. Below is a description of the specific metrics and what they affect based on the background information provided by the platforms.

### Apps Script {docsify-ignore}
- Execution of the script (6 minutes / one execution)

  - The total maximum duration of * one * script run. Typically, lightweight templates are completed in seconds. It is possible to approach a minute or several in the case of a large amount of input and / or output data.
   - For example, the function [getFollowedTracks](#sourcegetfollowedtrackstype-userid) for the user [spotify](#https://open.spotify.com/user/spotify) and the `owned` argument runs on average in 4 minutes. At the same time, receiving 1.4 thousand playlists and 102 thousand tracks. After removing duplicates, 78 thousand remain.
   - If you call for 78 thousand [rangeTracks](#filterrangetrackstracks-args) the limit of 6 minutes will be exceeded. But having previously discarded unsuitable tracks in advance, for example, using [rangeDateRel](#filterrangedatereltracks-sincedays-beforedays), [match](#filtermatchtracks-strregex-invert) and other things, you can significantly and quickly reduce the number of tracks.

- Number of requests (20 thousand / day)

  - Typically, 1 request to Spotify is 50 playlists or 50 tracks. In some cases, 100.
  - The example above received 1.4 thousand playlists and 102 thousand tracks for 1,735 requests.
  - To receive 11 thousand playlist tracks 110 requests and 25 seconds. About the same amount to create a playlist with that many tracks.
  - It will take 200 requests to get 10 thousand favorite tracks.
  - In general, it is difficult to imagine a function for 20 thousand requests due to the 6 minute execution limit. For this reason, it can be said that you cannot bypass all the playlists of robot users with thousands of playlists. But a personal profile or average authors are possible.

- Execution of triggers (90 minutes / day)

   - The total maximum duration of triggers. The only way to reach the limit is to call the function 15 times for 6 minutes in one day. It is difficult to imagine a task that will require this and will pay off.

- Number of triggers (20 / user / script)
  
   - In a rough description, these are 20 playlists that are created on completely * different * schedules.
   - In practice, several functions can be called from one other function, which allows you to create N playlists in one trigger. In this case, one trigger is always busy updating [listening history](#история-прослушиваний).
     ```js
     // Один триггер на функцию, создающую/обновляющую несколько плейлистов
     function somePlaylists(){
           templateOne();
           templateTwo();
           // и т.д.
     }
     ```
   - Alternatively, you can create another copy of the library and also get a 20 trigger quota.
  
      > If you need to create another copy, you can reuse the CLIENT_ID and CLIENT_SECRET values and not create a new application on the Spotify side.

The rest of Apps Script's limitations are not library specific. They are related to mail, spreadsheets and other services. Or unreachable due to Spotify Web API limitations. More details [here](https://developers.google.com/apps-script/guides/services/quotas).

### Web API Spotify {docsify-ignore}
- Local files are ignored. [API does not allow](https://developer.spotify.com/documentation/general/guides/local-files-spotify-playlists/) add such tracks to new playlists and practically do not contain data for filtering, sorting.
  
  > It is not currently possible to add local files to playlists using the Web API, but they can be reordered or removed.

- Number of tracks
  - When adding up to 11 thousand tracks to the playlist.
  - When you receive 11 thousand from one playlist.
  - Favorite tracks up to 20 thousand.
  - When filtering, sorting, choosing, the number is unlimited. But within the Apps Script quota.
- Number of playlists
  - Theoretically up to 11 thousand, but there will not be enough Apps Script quota to receive tracks from them. The real value is within 2 thousand. Depends on the total number of tracks.
- Number of requests
  - There is no exact number. If the volume of requests is too large in a short period of time, errors 500, 503, and the like may appear. Pass after a pause.
  
### Google Drive {docsify-ignore}
- The size of one text file is limited to 50 mb. To reduce the volume, you can use [Cache.compressTracks](/func?id=compresstracks). Experimentally, we managed to score a file with 100 thousand ** compressed ** tracks and keep within 50 mb.

## Listening history

The Spotify Web API has a method to get the listening history. But it allows you to get * a maximum * of the last 50 tracks that have been listened to for more than 30 seconds. The history does not include podcasts and tracks listened to in private mode.

Goofy automatically tracks your listening history for up to 20,000 tracks. When the limit is reached, new listening is still retained by deleting the oldest. The tracking process starts right after the Goofy setup is complete. Duplicates are not removed.

This opportunity appears due to the Google Apps Script platform and its access to Google Drive. It contains a file with the listening history. Goofy periodically calls Spotify and updates the file with new data. The theoretical update period is 25 minutes (30 seconds multiplied by the 50 track limit). In practice, an update is requested every 15 minutes. This value is dictated as the closest and acceptable by the Apps Script platform.

Theoretically, the limit can be 30 or 100 thousand. But there is a question of performance within the limits of the Apps Script platform, the availability of Drive disk space and, in general, the appropriateness of such an array. Working with the current limit of 20 thousand will show how realistic the theory is in practice.

Additionally, the listen history from Last.fm is available. More details in the reference.

Cumulative and ** recommended ** is [RecentTracks.get](/func?id=get).

> ❗️ In practice, the Spotify API is unstable. After 30 seconds, the track may return with a delay or be completely lost. Read more [from here](https://4pda.ru/forum/index.php?s=&showtopic=715234&view=findpost&p=101348829) and so on.
